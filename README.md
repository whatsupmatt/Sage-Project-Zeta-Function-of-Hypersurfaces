# Sage-Project-Zeta-Function-of-Hypersurfaces 
-Use Calculate Basis for E2 Page and Subdiagonal file to find the basis of the rigid cohomology groups. \
-Use Frobenius reduction for cubics or quartics to find the zeta function. \
-For those interested in seeing how to use the code, I made a video explaining how to find the zeta function for a hypersurface with 2 A2 singularities. Here are the links. It is split into 3 videos. I have posted them in the order you should watch them. \
